# WhatsApp Visitor Management System

## Overview

A WhatsApp-based Visitor Management System designed for residential communities.

Residents can generate temporary visitor access codes directly through WhatsApp without installing any mobile application. Security guards can verify visitor codes through a simple verification interface, while administrators can manage residents and monitor visitor activity through a centralized dashboard.
